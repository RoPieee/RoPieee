[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20the%20latest%20release-2025.08-blue)](/docs/CHANGELOG.md#2025.08)

RoPieee is an image for the Raspberry Pi devices (3, 4 and 5 family) that is capable of running several audio streaming platforms. RoPieee can be seen as an appliance, and as such requires no computer knowledge whatsoever. RoPieee's functionality is often called a 'network bridge'.

## Introduction

These days many :musical_note: fans listen to music via a streaming solution. If you own something of HiFi gear (more then just your phone), with a separate DAC for example, the Raspberry Pi device is a very nice and affordable solution for acting as a network bridge.
RoPieee is an appliance that makes it possible to turn your Raspberry Pi in a very capable streaming endpoint, within 15 minutes. Just insert an MicroSD card, turn it on, and grab a cup of coffee. After 15 minutes RoPieee is ready to go, and can be configured from an easy to understand web interface.

## Quick start

1. Download the right image from [here](/docs/CHANGELOG.md)
2. Burn the image to an MicroSD card (minimal 8GB) with a tool like [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
3. Make sure you have a wired ethernet cable plugged in.
4. Insert the MicroSD card in the Raspberry Pi and power it up. 
5. Grab a cup of :coffee: (or a :tropical_drink:)
6. After 15 minutes or so, you should be able to reach RoPieee's webpage at http://ropieee.local

_You're now ready to stream music using Roon! For detailed information please have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md)_

## Highlights :sparkles:

RoPieee can act as an endpoint for [Roon](https://roonlabs.com), Spotify, Airplay (2), [Lyrion](https://lyrion.org/) (former Logitech/Squeezebox), UPnP, [HQPlayer](https://signalyst.com/consumer/) and [Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/). It provides support for the official Raspberry Pi touchscreens (both version 1 and 2) while using Roon, has extensive support for remote controls ([Flirc](https://flirc.tv/), OSMC and generic USB input devices) and has an advanced update mechanism.
