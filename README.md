An easy-to-use Raspberry Pi image for network audio streaming solutions.

RoPieee is an image for the Raspberry Pi devices (3,4 and 5 family) that is capable of running several audio streaming platforms. RoPieee can be seen as an appliance, and as such requires no computer knowledge whatsoever.

## Introduction

These days many :musical_note: fans listen to music via a streaming solution. If you own something of HiFi gear (more then just your phone), with a separate DAC for example, the Raspberry Pi device is a very nice and affordable solution for acting as a network bridge.
RoPieee is an appliance that makes it possible to turn your Raspberry Pi in a very capable streaming endpoint, within 10 minutes. Just insert an SD card, turn it on, and grab a cup of coffee. After 10 minutes RoPieee is ready to go, and can be configured from an easy to understand web interface.

## Quick start

1. Download the right image from https://ropieee.org/software
2. Burn the image to an SD card (minimal 8GB) with a tool like [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
3. Make sure you have a wired ethernet cable plugged in.
4. Insert the SD card in the Raspberry Pi and power it up. 
5. Grab a cup of :coffee: (or a :tropical_drink:)
6. After 10 minutes or so, you should be able to reach RoPieee's webpage at http://ropieee.local
7. You can configure several services from the services tab, but by default RoPieee runs [Roon Bridge](https://roonlabs.com) out of the box.
8. RoPieee supports several audio HAT's that can be configured on the audio tab. USB Audio, for connecting USB DAC's, is enabled by default.
