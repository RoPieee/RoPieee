# RoPieee
An easy-to-use Raspberry Pi image for audio streaming solutions.

RoPieee is an image for the Raspberry Pi devices (3,4 and 5 family) that is capable of running several audio streaming platforms. RoPieee can be seen as an appliance, and as such requires no computer knowledge whatsoever.

## Introduction

These days many music fans listen to music via a streaming solution. If you own something of HiFi gear (more then just your phone), with a separate DAC for example, the Raspberry Pi device is a very nice and affordable solution for acting as a network bridge.
RoPieee is an appliance that makes it possible to turn your Raspberry Pi in a very capable streaming endpoint, within 10 minutes. Just insert an SD card, turn it on, and grab a cup of coffee. After 10 minutes RoPieee is ready to go, and can be configured from an easy to understand web interface.

3. Insert the SD card in the Raspberry Pi and power it up. Make sure it has a wired ethernet cable plugged in.
4. Grab a cup of :coffee:
5. After 10 minutes or so, you should be able to reach RoPieee's webpage at https://ropieee.local
6. You can configure several services from the services tab, but by default RoPieee runs [Roon Bridge](https://roonlabs.com) out of the box
