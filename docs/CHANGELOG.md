# RoPieee Releases

We release on a regular basis to fix bugs or implement new features. Stability is of the highest importance here: RoPieee is foremost meant to listen to music and should be 'out-of-the-way'.

## Updates ##

A RoPieee unit checks for updates every few hours. When it finds an update it will download it in the background. When it's downloaded the user will get a notification in the webbrowser from where it can choose to update the unit.
